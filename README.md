📝 **Project Description – IELTS Speaking Test Web App**
This web application is designed to help users practice for the IELTS Speaking Test in an interactive and user-friendly environment. Built using Vite, React, and TypeScript, the application enables users to record their voice, receive dynamic questions, and interact through a clean, responsive interface.

💡** Key Features**
🎤 Audio Recording
The application integrates the browser’s MediaRecorder API, allowing users to record answers in real-time. The recorded audio can be played back or submitted for analysis.

📋 **Dynamic Question Generation**
Questions are dynamically fetched from a Flask backend. These simulate real IELTS speaking prompts and are generated using AI or predefined datasets.

📊 **Dashboard View**
Users can navigate through the application using a dashboard interface that displays available tests, submission status, and possibly their scores or progress (future enhancement).

🔧 **Technology Stack**
Frontend:

Vite (fast dev build tool)

React (UI library)

TypeScript (type-safe JavaScript)

Backend (not included in this repo):

Flask (Python-based REST API)

API handles question generation and response handling

Others:
